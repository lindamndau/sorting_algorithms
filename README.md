Sorting Algorithms Repository
This repository contains implementations of three fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and provides a simple and efficient way to sort arrays/lists of elements.

Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Insertion Sort: Another simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates over the input data, removing one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs to in the already-sorted part of the array, and inserts it there. It repeats this process until no input elements remain.

Quick Sort: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. The pivot can be chosen in various ways; this implementation uses the last element as the pivot. After partitioning, the pivot is in its final sorted position, and the algorithm applies recursively to the sub-arrays on the left and right of the pivot.

About the Author
These sorting algorithms were implemented by Linda Mndau, a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in algorithms and data structures. Linda enjoys exploring different sorting techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.
